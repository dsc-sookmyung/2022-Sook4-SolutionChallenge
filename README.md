# BeanYard üå±

## ‚ùì What is BeanYard?
> Only **0.2%** of coffee grounds are used in a cup of coffee, and the remaining **98.9%** are often discarded without being used. About **15g** of coffee grounds are used to make a cup of Americano, of which **14.97g** is thrown away.
> 
> Coffee grounds are now discharged as waste, but they are **organic resources with high recycling value.**
> 
> So we thought about ways to **recycle coffee grounds.**

## :tomato: Functions
**1Ô∏è‚É£ The Intermediate Role Connecting The Cafe Owner And The Farmer**
    
    - Most of the people who join our site are owning cafe or working at a cafe.
    
    - We help them sign up and let them enter information about the cafe they operate,
      so that when they want to donate their coffee grounds, we can go to their cafe and collect coffee grounds directly,
      or receive the package they sent us.
      
    - The coffee gourds they received are not thrown away, but used as a fertilizer.
    
    - Farm owners don't have to sign up for our services directly, because BeanYard managers take over their roles and manage themselves in-between.
    
    - By acting as a middle manager, we are expanding our projects in various directions.
      1) Receiving coffee grounds, Making fertilizers, and Delivering them to farmers.
      2) Selling Home Gardening kits including fertilizers to make profits.
 
**2Ô∏è‚É£ Climate Action Trough Funding**

    - We started funding to promote Climate Change to people who are not familiar with it.
    
    - It is to help everyone solve the Greenhouse Gas Problem by selling eco-freindly Home Gardening kits,
      including fertilizers made from coffee grounds.
    
    - Funding has the advantage of more convenient distribution of revenue structures,
      quick promotion of our projects,
      and easy access to even those who are not interested in crops or fertilizers.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ ECO REMINDER**

    - We keep BeanYard users reminded of the praiseworthy Climate Action they are doing themselves.
    
    - Members who use BeanYard can use My Page and feel proud to see cute vegetable characters gather one by one depending on the amount of coffee they collect.
    
    - In addition, anyone visiting BeanYard for the first time,
      can check the number of people who have helped with Climate Action with us,
      and the amount of coffee they have collected with us by referring to the main page and About us page.
      After confirming, everyone will have a desire to participate.

## ‚ú® top 50: We developed the project as below ‚Ä¶

    1. Regular Donation System
    - Regular donations are available as well as one-time donations. 
    - When a user selects a regular donation, the donations are automatically generated for each selected period.
    
    2. Donation Box for Coffee Grounds Collection
    - we created a Donation Box page that shows the user the location of the nearby Collection Box.
    
    3. Make Rewards Intuitive
    - Rewards was modified growing sprouts, not crops, to make users feel intuitively.
    
    4. Changing Landing Page, Navigation Bar
    - To clearly show the purpose and direction of the service, we included the service process on the landing page
    - We also reorganized the top navigation bar and each contents to increase the readability and usability.
    
    5. Objective indicators through research
    - It was observed that coffee grounds fertilizer had more than four times the growth of plants than normal fertilizer.
    - The fertilizer made from coffee grounds is sufficiently valuable as a fertilizer and is still in use.

- UI/UX implement
    
    UI
    
    - The farm owner's UI was moved to the manager's page UI, which showed a general approach in the form of a coffee grounds collection list at a glance and a map and a cafe location when clicked on one.
    
    UX
    
    - The Main page in the existing Header was replaced with intuitive keywords such as ‚ÄòMy Donations‚Äô for cafe owners and ‚ÄòDonations‚Äô for admins to ease confusion.
    - ‚ÄòAbout us‚Äô and ‚ÄòHow to‚Äô in the Header seemed to overlap at once, so we improved it by leaving only ‚ÄòAbout us‚Äô to show the data we collected through donations.
    - It has been improved to be able to return to the previous step when entering information during the donation steps.
    - At the donation process, it specifies how to pack the coffee grounds, the address where the courier will be sent, and how to process the delivery fee.
