# BeanYard 🌱

## ❓ What is BeanYard?
> Only **0.2%** of coffee grounds are used in a cup of coffee, and the remaining **98.9%** are often discarded without being used. About **15g** of coffee grounds are used to make a cup of Americano, of which **14.97g** is thrown away.
> 
> Coffee grounds are now discharged as waste, but they are **organic resources with high recycling value.**
> 
> So we thought about ways to **recycle coffee grounds.**

## :tomato: Functions
**1️⃣ The Intermediate Role Connecting The Cafe Owner And The Farmer**
    
    - Most of the people who join our site are owning cafe or working at a cafe.
    
    - We help them sign up and let them enter information about the cafe they operate,
      so that when they want to donate their coffee grounds, we can go to their cafe and collect coffee grounds directly,
      or receive the package they sent us.
      
    - The coffee gourds they received are not thrown away, but used as a fertilizer.
    
    - Farm owners don't have to sign up for our services directly, because BeanYard managers take over their roles and manage themselves in-between.
    
    - By acting as a middle manager, we are expanding our projects in various directions.
      1) Receiving coffee grounds, Making fertilizers, and Delivering them to farmers.
      2) Selling Home Gardening kits including fertilizers to make profits.
 
**2️⃣ Climate Action Trough Funding**

    - We started funding to promote Climate Change to people who are not familiar with it.
    
    - It is to help everyone solve the Greenhouse Gas Problem by selling eco-freindly Home Gardening kits,
      including fertilizers made from coffee grounds.
    
    - Funding has the advantage of more convenient distribution of revenue structures,
      quick promotion of our projects,
      and easy access to even those who are not interested in crops or fertilizers.

**3️⃣ ECO REMINDER**

    - We keep BeanYard users reminded of the praiseworthy Climate Action they are doing themselves.
    
    - Members who use BeanYard can use My Page and feel proud to see cute vegetable characters gather one by one depending on the amount of coffee they collect.
    
    - In addition, anyone visiting BeanYard for the first time,
      can check the number of people who have helped with Climate Action with us,
      and the amount of coffee they have collected with us by referring to the main page and About us page.
      After confirming, everyone will have a desire to participate.

## 🍉 Whole Process
(페이지들 보여주면서 설명하기)
+ 설명하면서 아래 개선점을 같이 얘기해주면 좋을것 같음
2. UI, UX 개선
    
    2-1. UI
    
    - 농장 주인의 UI가 관리자용 페이지 UI로 넘어가게 되었는데, 이 과정에서 커피박 수거 리스트를 한 눈에 보여주고 하나를 클릭하면 지도와 함께 카페의 위치를 알려주는 형식으로 일반적인 접근 방법을 보여주었습니다.
    
    2-2. UX
    
    - 기존 Header에 존재하는 Main 페이지를 My Donations (카페 주인의 경우), Donations (관리자의 겨우) 등 직관적인 키워드로 바꾸어 혼란을 덜어주었습니다.
    - 기존 Header에 존재하는 About us, How to 페이지의 성격이 겹치는 듯한 느낌이 들고 한번에 확 와닿지 않았는데, About us 페이지만 남겨두고 거기에 우리가 커피박 수거를 통해 이룬 데이터를 보여주는 형식으로 개선했습니다.
